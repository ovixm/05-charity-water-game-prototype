# Charity: water Game Prototype

In this project, you’ll begin transforming your game concept from last week into a working interactive prototype using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This first version should focus on core functionality — clickable elements, score tracking, and a basic layout. The goal is to bring your idea to life with simple, working mechanics that you’ll refine and expand in the next milestone.
